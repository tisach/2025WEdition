#### Completed

- ✅ Refactor clock functionality into stopwatch class (see `cs.cpp` and `../Helper`)

#### Possible next steps

- Try to capture the latency for many context switches; output csv style
- Python script to convert csv file to diagram
- Measure procedure call overhead
- Compare C version (`cs.c`) vs C++ version (`cs.cpp`) timing overhead

... any additional ideas?
